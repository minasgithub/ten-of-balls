The data for this App has been retrieved from the official BallDontLie API.
The data seems to be outdated and is per se not filterable (while it is possible to request different endpoints, most filters don't actually work).
That is why the data shown on my App is not filterable at the moment and limited in scope. With more time, I would have liked to use the official NBA data, which seems to be much more detailed and up-to-date. I also set up a graph component, for which I intended to use the data of the best players since 2020, but I could not retrieve that data. Such graphs would be interesting and informative, as well as visually appealing, and would definitely be ideal to include in an app like this.
